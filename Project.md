### Mid Sem Evaluation

#### Continuous Learning and Anomaly Detection
- Various ML models to detect anomalies and retrain the model updating detection logic in real time
- why? Reduces number of zero day attack and false positives

#### Autonomous Reasoning & Decision Making
- LangChain is python framework for creating and integration of Agentic AI
- ML model alerts are processed by this Module and the generates commands in Natural Language in JSON format (action , target , reason)
- Adv - Alert Fatigue is reduced as it provides context for the threats

#### SIEM Integration and Centralized Oversight
- This unit is responsible for responding to the commands generated by LangChain  module

#### Decentralized Architecture and Scalability
- Container
	- Scale container according to Load using Docker Swarm
- Docker
	- Independent Container
	- Docker Compose & Swarm for Load Balancing , Restart on failure
