### Introduction
#### Scarcity and Efficiency
- Explore the behavior of the finance markets , including interest rates and stock prices
- Examines the reasons why some countries have high income while others are poor and suggest ways to raise the income without harming the economy
- Business Cycles
- International trade and finance and the impacts on globalization
- Looking at the growing countries and propose ways to encourage the efficient use of resources
- Government policies to rapid economic growth , efficient use of resources

- **Economics** is study of how societies use scarce resources to produce valuable commodities and distribute among different people
- Unlimited wants and limited resources
- Inefficiency == Underdevelopment
- we say that an economy is producing efficiently when it cannot make anyone economically better off without making someone else worse off.

#### Importance and Use of Microeconomics
- Price determination and allocation of resources
- Business Decision making
- guide of production and planning
- basis for prediction
- government policies 

#### Three Problems of Economic Organisation
- What?
- How?
- For whom?

#### Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)
- shows the maximum production that could be obtained by an economy , given its technological knowledge and quantity of inputs.
- Menu of available goods and services
- reflects choices between the current consumption and future investment
- Sacrificing the current consumption and increasing the capital goods

- Productive efficiency occurs when an economy cannot produce more of one good without producing less of another goods; this implies that the economy is on its production-possibility frontier.
- Being on PPF means that producing more of one good inevitably requires sacrificing other goods.
-  When there are unemployed resources, the economy is not on its PPF but somewhat inside.

#### Failure of Market Economy

1. **Inefficiency:**
    
    - **Monopoly:** When a single company dominates a market, it can lead to higher prices and reduced innovation.
        
        - _Example:_ A single telecom company controlling an entire country's network might charge exorbitant fees.
        - **Government Intervention:** Encourage competition.
        - **Example of Policy:** Antitrust laws that break up monopolies (e.g., the US government's action against Microsoft in the 1990s).
    - **Externalities:** Costs or benefits that affect third parties who are not directly involved in an economic transaction.
        
        - _Example:_ Air pollution from a factory affects the health of nearby residents.
        - **Government Intervention:** Intervene in markets.
        - **Example of Policy:** Antipollution laws, carbon taxes, or smoking bans to limit negative externalities.
    - **Public Goods:** Goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning they benefit everyone, but private firms may not supply them efficiently.
        
        - _Example:_ Street lighting benefits all drivers and pedestrians, but private firms have little incentive to provide it.
        - **Government Intervention:** Encourage beneficial activities.
        - **Example of Policy:** Government builds infrastructure like roads and provides free public education.
2. **Inequality:**
    
    - **Unacceptable Inequalities of Income and Wealth:** Some people earn significantly more than others, leading to social instability.
        - _Example:_ CEOs earning millions while workers struggle with low wages.
        - **Government Intervention:** Redistribute income.
        - **Example of Policy:** Progressive taxation, where higher-income earners pay a larger percentage in taxes, and income support programs like food stamps.
3. **Macroeconomic Problems:**
    
    - **Business Cycles (High Inflation and Unemployment):** Economic fluctuations cause inflation (rising prices) or unemployment.
        
        - _Example:_ A recession may lead to job losses, while high inflation reduces purchasing power.
        - **Government Intervention:** Stabilize through macroeconomic policies.
        - **Example of Policy:** Central banks adjusting interest rates to control inflation or unemployment.
    - **Slow Economic Growth:** When an economy grows too slowly, living standards may not improve.
        
        - _Example:_ A country experiencing low GDP growth may struggle to provide jobs.
        - **Government Intervention:** Stimulate growth.
        - **Example of Policy:** Tax cuts, increased government spending on infrastructure, or policies to boost national savings.



### Basic Element of Supply and Demand
#### Theory of Supply and Demand
- This theory shows how consumer preferences determine consumer demand for commodities, while business costs are the foundation of the supply of commodities.
- This relationship between price and quantity bought is called the demand schedule, or demand curve.

##### Law of Downward Sloping Demand
- When prices of commodities rise the consumer tends to buy less of the same commodity and vice versa
- Reason :
	- Substitution Effect
	- Income Effect
- Factors influencing the market
	- Avg income
	- market size
	- Price and availability of goods
	- Taste or Preferences
- Exception to Law of Demand
	- Display of Wealth 
	- Giffen Good
	- It was noted by Sir Robert Giffen III that in Ireland during the 19th century there was a rise in the price of bread. The poor people were forced to reduce their consumption of meat and expensive items as eggs etc. Now bread being still the cheapest food, so they started consuming more of it though its price was rising. This phenomenon is often described as "Giffen's Paradox".
##### Law of supply
- Supply tends to rise with rising prices and vice versa.
- Factors affecting the supply curve
	- Technology
	- Input Price
	- Price of related goods
	- Government Policies
	- Special Influences


#### Equilibrium of supply and demand

- If more supply than demand then price drops to increase the demand
- if more demand than supply then price rise to reduce the demand
