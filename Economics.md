### Introduction
#### Scarcity and Efficiency
- Explore the behavior of the finance markets , including interest rates and stock prices
- Examines the reasons why some countries have high income while others are poor and suggest ways to raise the income without harming the economy
- Business Cycles
- International trade and finance and the impacts on globalization
- Looking at the growing countries and propose ways to encourage the efficient use of resources
- Government policies to rapid economic growth , efficient use of resources

- **Economics** is study of how societies use scarce resources to produce valuable commodities and distribute among different people
- Unlimited wants and limited resources
- Inefficiency == Underdevelopment
- we say that an economy is producing efficiently when it cannot make anyone economically better off without making someone else worse off.

#### Importance and Use of Microeconomics
- Price determination and allocation of resources
- Business Decision making
- guide of production and planning
- basis for prediction
- government policies 

#### Three Problems of Economic Organisation
- What?
- How?
- For whom?

#### Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)
- shows the maximum production that could be obtained by an economy , given its technological knowledge and quantity of inputs.
- Menu of available goods and services
- reflects choices between the current consumption and future investment
- Sacrificing the current consumption and increasing the capital goods


![[Pasted image 20250305000754.png]]
- Productive efficiency occurs when an economy cannot produce more of one good without producing less of another goods; this implies that the economy is on its production-possibility frontier.
- Being on PPF means that producing more of one good inevitably requires sacrificing other goods.
-  When there are unemployed resources, the economy is not on its PPF but somewhat inside.

#### Failure of Market Economy

1. **Inefficiency:**
    
    - **Monopoly:** When a single company dominates a market, it can lead to higher prices and reduced innovation.
        
        - _Example:_ A single telecom company controlling an entire country's network might charge exorbitant fees.
        - **Government Intervention:** Encourage competition.
        - **Example of Policy:** Antitrust laws that break up monopolies (e.g., the US government's action against Microsoft in the 1990s).
    - **Externalities:** Costs or benefits that affect third parties who are not directly involved in an economic transaction.
        
        - _Example:_ Air pollution from a factory affects the health of nearby residents.
        - **Government Intervention:** Intervene in markets.
        - **Example of Policy:** Antipollution laws, carbon taxes, or smoking bans to limit negative externalities.
    - **Public Goods:** Goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning they benefit everyone, but private firms may not supply them efficiently.
        
        - _Example:_ Street lighting benefits all drivers and pedestrians, but private firms have little incentive to provide it.
        - **Government Intervention:** Encourage beneficial activities.
        - **Example of Policy:** Government builds infrastructure like roads and provides free public education.
2. **Inequality:**
    
    - **Unacceptable Inequalities of Income and Wealth:** Some people earn significantly more than others, leading to social instability.
        - _Example:_ CEOs earning millions while workers struggle with low wages.
        - **Government Intervention:** Redistribute income.
        - **Example of Policy:** Progressive taxation, where higher-income earners pay a larger percentage in taxes, and income support programs like food stamps.
3. **Macroeconomic Problems:**
    
    - **Business Cycles (High Inflation and Unemployment):** Economic fluctuations cause inflation (rising prices) or unemployment.
        
        - _Example:_ A recession may lead to job losses, while high inflation reduces purchasing power.
        - **Government Intervention:** Stabilize through macroeconomic policies.
        - **Example of Policy:** Central banks adjusting interest rates to control inflation or unemployment.
    - **Slow Economic Growth:** When an economy grows too slowly, living standards may not improve.
        
        - _Example:_ A country experiencing low GDP growth may struggle to provide jobs.
        - **Government Intervention:** Stimulate growth.
        - **Example of Policy:** Tax cuts, increased government spending on infrastructure, or policies to boost national savings.



### Basic Element of Supply and Demand
#### Theory of Supply and Demand
- This theory shows how consumer preferences determine consumer demand for commodities, while business costs are the foundation of the supply of commodities.
- This relationship between price and quantity bought is called the demand schedule, or demand curve.

##### Law of Downward Sloping Demand
- When prices of commodities rise the consumer tends to buy less of the same commodity and vice versa
- Reason :
	- Substitution Effect
	- Income Effect
- Factors influencing the market
	- Avg income
	- market size
	- Price and availability of goods
	- Taste or Preferences
- Exception to Law of Demand
	- Display of Wealth 
	- Giffen Good
	- It was noted by Sir Robert Giffen III that in Ireland during the 19th century there was a rise in the price of bread. The poor people were forced to reduce their consumption of meat and expensive items as eggs etc. Now bread being still the cheapest food, so they started consuming more of it though its price was rising. This phenomenon is often described as "Giffen's Paradox".
##### Law of supply
- Supply tends to rise with rising prices and vice versa.
- Factors affecting the supply curve
	- Technology
	- Input Price
	- Price of related goods
	- Government Policies
	- Special Influences


#### Equilibrium of supply and demand
![[Pasted image 20250305003810.png]]![[Pasted image 20250305003929.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250305003942.png]]

- If more supply than demand then price drops to increase the demand
- if more demand than supply then price rise to reduce the demand
![[Pasted image 20250305005643.png]]

- For same price if supply quantity is reduced then price increases (because of low demand) (1st)
- For same price if demand increases then price increases (supply quantity increases) (2nd)
![[Pasted image 20250305005859.png]]


### Applications of Supply and Demand
#### Price Elasticity of Demand
- the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.
- Elastic - Quantity Demanded Varies greatly based on Price -- Luxury goods -- Easily substituted
- Inelastic - Little response to price change -- Necessity goods -- 
- Demand elasticity are generally higher in long run
- Elasticities tend to be higher when 
	- the goods are luxuries, when
	- substitutes are available, and 
	- when consumers have more time to adjust their behavior. 
![[Pasted image 20250305011322.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250305011345.png]]
- Perfectly Elastic Horizontal line
- Perfectly Elastic Vertical
 ![[Pasted image 20250305011630.png]]
##### Slope is not same as elasticity
![[Pasted image 20250305011732.png]]
- Slope is constant but the commodity changes from elastic to inelastic

##### Elasticity and Revenue
- Total Revenue = Total Quantiy * Price per good
![[Pasted image 20250305012209.png]]


#### Price Elasticity of Supply
- Price Elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.


### Production and Business Organization

- Productive capacity is determined by the size and quality of the labor force, by the quantity  and quality of the capital stock, by the nation’s technical knowledge along with the ability to use that knowledge, and by the nature of public and private institutions.
- The relationship between the amount of input required and the amount of output that can be obtained is called the production function.

#### Total , Average , Marginal Product
- Total Product is total amount of output produced
- Marginal Product is extra output produced by 1 additional input while other factors are constant
- Average Product is total output divided by total input
![[Pasted image 20250305021546.png]]

#### Law of Diminishing Returns
- When we get less extra output for the additional doses of input 
- In other word marginal utility of each product diminishes as input increases
- Living standards in crowded India or Bangladesh are low because there are so many workers per acre of land and not because farmers are ignorant or fail to respond to economic incentives.

#### Return to Scale
- What if we increase all the inputs rather than just one
- Constant Return to Scale 
	- Denotes the case where changes in all input leads to proportional increase in output
- Increasing Return to Scale (Economies of Sales)
	- Denotes  the case where changes in all input leads to more than proportional changes in output
- Decreasing Return to Scale
	- When a balanced increase in input leads to less than proportional increase in output
	- Might arise due to high cost of management

#### Short Run and Long Run
- Time is also an input to Production
- Short run is a period in which forms can adjust production by changing variable factors such as material and labor but cannot change fixed factors such as capital.
- The long run is a period sufficiently long that all factor including capital can be adjusted. In the long run more efficient production processes can be installed so that level of efficiency can permanently be increased.

#### Technological Change
- Product Innovation , when new engineering knowledge improves production techniques for existing product , leads to shift in production function
#### Productivity and the Aggregate Production function 
- Productivity is a concept measuring the total output to a weighted average of total inputs.
- Aggregate Production function = GDP

#### Productivity Growth from Economies of Sales
- Productivity grows due to economies of sales and technological change
- While the technology might ideally allow constant or increasing returns to scale , the need for management and supervision may result in decreasing return to scale

#### Business Organizations
- Business firms are special organizations involved in managing the process of production
- Functions 
	- Exploiting the economies of mass production
	- raising funds
	- organizing the factors of production


### Demand and Consumer Behavior

#### Choice and Utility
- People choose those goods that give them maximum utility
- Utility means Satisfaction
- Utility is a scientific construct that economist use to understand how rational consumers divide their limited resources among the commodities that provide them with satisfaction.

#### Marginal Utility and Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
- The increment to utility by the consumption of an additional unit is called marginal utility.
- Marginal utility denotes the additional utility you get from the consumption of an additional unit of a commodity.
- Law of diminishing marginal utility states that the marginal utility decreases for the consumer as he/she consumes more and more of good
- We can also say total utility increases at a decreasing rate
- Ordinal Utility: - Economist today generally reject the notion of a cardinal (or measurable) utility that people feel or experience when consuming goods and services.
- What counts for modern Demand theory is the principle of ordinal utility. Under this approach, consumer need to determine only their preference ranking of bundles of commodities.

#### Equimarginal Principle
- Equimarginal Principle: This fundamental condition of maximum satisfaction or utility is the Equimarginal principle. It states that a consumer having a fixed income and facing given market prices of goods will achieve maximum satisfaction or utility when the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on each good is exactly the same as the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on any other good.
- "Why must this hold"
	- If any one good gave more marginal utility per dollar, I would increase my utility by taking money away from other goods and spending more on that good- until the law of diminishing marginal utility drove its marginal utility per dollar down to equality with that of other goods.
	- If any good gave less marginal utility per dollar than the common level, I would buy less of it until the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on it had risen back to the common level.
	- The common marginal utility per dollar of all commodities in consumer equilibrium is called the marginal utility of income.
![[Pasted image 20250305030908.png]]

###### Income Elasticity
- Measure of Income Effect
- Percentage change in quantity demanded by percentage change in income

#### Key Concepts
- The substitution effect occurs when a higher price leads to substitution of other goods for the good whose price has risen.
- The income effect is the change in the quantity demanded of a good because the change in its price has the effect of changing a consumers’ real income.
- Income elasticity is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good divided by the percentage change in income.
- Goods are substitutes if an increase in the price of one increase the demand for the other.
- Goods are complements if an increase in the price of one decreases the demand for the other.
- Goods are independent if a price change for one has no effect on the demand for the other.

#### The Paradox of Value
- The total utility from water consumption does not determine its price or demand. Rather, water’s price is determined by its marginal utility.
- The more there is of a commodity, the less is the relative desirability of its last little unit. It is therefore clear why water has a low price.
-  The large quantity pull the marginal utilities so far down and thus reduce the prices of these vital commodities.

#### Consumer Surplus
- The gap between the total utility of a good and its total market value is called consumer surplus. The surplus arises because we “receive more than we pay for” as a result of the law of diminishing marginal utility.
- Because consumers pay the price of the last unit for all units consumed, they enjoy a surplus of utility over cost. Consumer surplus measures the extra value that consumers received above what they pay for a commodity.
- Economist use consumer surplus when they are performing a cost-benefit analysis, which attempts to determine the costs and benefit of a government programme

### Analysis of Cost

#### Economic Analysis of Cost
- **Fixed Cost** - 
	- Represent the total expenses that is paid out even when no output is produced
	- Unaffected by any variation in the quantity of output
- **Variable Cost** -
	- Vary with the output level such as raw materials, wages etc.
- **Total Cost** -
	- TC = FC + VC
- **Marginal Cost** -
	- Additional cost of producing 1 extra unit of output
- TC is related to MC in the same way that total product is related to marginal product or the total utility is related to marginal utility.
- **Average - 
	- AC = TC / Quantity
	- AFC = FC / Quantity
	- AVC = VC / Quantity
![[Pasted image 20250305034550.png]]

#### Minimum Average Cost
- When the MC of an added unit of output is below its AC, its AC is declining. And when MC is above AC, AC is increasing. At the point where MC equals AC, the AC curve is flat. For the typical U-shaped AC curve, the point where MC equals AC is also the point where AC hits its minimum level.
- Therefore for minimum average cost firm must look at the point where the marginal costs equals the average costs (AVC and AC)
![[Pasted image 20250305034820.png]]
- If MC is below AC that is the cost of last unit is less than the average cost until now therefore the AC must fall
- if MC is above AC must rise
- The AC curve is pierced at its minimum by the MC curve


#### Production Costs

- Cost curves depends on the firms production function
- If you know factor prices and the production function, you can calculate the cost curves. The production function will tell us which is the least costly combination of inputs the firm can select that can yield the desired output.
![[Pasted image 20250305035513.png]]

#### Diminishing Returns and U-Shaped Cost Curves
- Consider the short run in which capital is fixed buy labor is variable . In such a situation, there are diminishing returns to the variable factor because each additional unit of variable factor has less capital to work with. As a result, the marginal cost of output will rise because the extra output produced by each extra variable unit is going down. In other words, diminishing returns to the variable factor will imply an increasing short-run marginal cost. This shows why diminishing returns lead to rising marginal costs after some point.
![[Pasted image 20250305035920.png]]

#### A Numerical Production Function
![[Pasted image 20250305040551.png]]

##### Least Cost Factor Combination for a given Output( q = 346 )
![[Pasted image 20250305040642.png]]
- if prices of input changes , the equilibrium proportion of the inputs will also change so as to use less of the input that has gone up

##### Equal Product Curves
- Diagrammatic approach by putting together 2 new curves , equal - product curve and equal cost curve
- Equal - Product smooth curve indicates all the different combinations of labor and land that yield an output of 346 units.
- Every point on a given equal-cost line represents the same total cost. The lines are straight because factor prices are constant and they all have a negative slope equal to the ratio of labor price to land price, $2/$3, and hence are parallel.
- Combining these two we can determine optimal cost 
![[Pasted image 20250305041100.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250305041120.png]]

##### Least Cost Condition
- Step 1 : Calculate marginal product of each input. 
- Step 2 : Divide the marginal product of each input  by its factor prices giving you marginal product per dollar of input
- The cost minimizing combination of input comes when the marginal product per dollar of input is equal for all inputs. That is, the marginal contribution to output of each dollar’s worth of labor, or land, of oil, and so forth must be the same.
- Least Cost Rule: To produce a given level of output at least cost, a firm should buy inputs until it has equalized the marginal product per dollar spent on each input.
- If the marginal products per $1 o f inputs were not equal, you could reduce the low MP-Per dollar and increase the high-MP-per-dollar input and produce the output at lower cost.
- A corollary of the least-cost rule is the substitution rule.
	- Substitution rule: If the price of one factor falls while all other factor prices remain the same, firms will profit by substituting the now-cheaper factor for the other factors until the marginal products per dollar are equal for all inputs.
