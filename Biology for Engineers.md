## UNIT 1
## Introduction to Living Organisms

- The cells of the onion peel will all look the same, regardless of the size of the onion they came from. These small structures that we see are the basic building units of the onion bulb. These structures are called cells. Not only onions, but all organisms that we observe around are made up of cells.
- It is now known that a single cell may constitute a whole organism as in Amoeba, Chlamydomonas, Paramoecium and bacteria. These organisms are called unicellular organisms (uni = single). On the other hand, many cells group together in a single body and assume different functions in it to form various body parts in multicellular organisms (multi = many) such as some fungi, plants and animals.
- The shape and size of cells are related to the specific function they perform. Some cells like Amoeba have changing shapes. In some cases the cell shape could be more or less fixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell; for example, nerve cells have a typical shape.

## Cell Organelles

### What?
- The human body has a heart to pump blood, a stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly, division of labour is also seen within a single cell. In fact, each such cell has got certain specific components within it known as cell organelles. 
- Each kind of cell organelle performs a special function, such as making new material in the cell, clearing up the waste material from the cell and so on. A cell is able to live and perform all its functions because of these organelles. 
- These organelles together constitute the basic unit called the cell. It is interesting that all cells are found to have the same organelles, no matter what their function is or what organism they are found in.


### Plasma Membrane
- This is the outermost covering of the cell that separates the contents of the cell from its external environment. The plasma membrane allows or permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of the cell. It also prevents movement of some other materials. The cell membrane, therefore, is called a selectively permeable membrane.
- Some substances like carbon dioxide or oxygen can move across the cell membrane by a process called diffusion. We saw that there is spontaneous movement of a substance from a region of high concentration to a region where its concentration is low. Diffusion plays an important role in gaseous exchange between the cells as well as the cell and its external environment.
- Water also obeys the law of diffusion. The movement of water molecules through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis. The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water. Thus, osmosis is the passage of water from a region of high water concentration through a selectively permeable membrane to a region of low water concentration till equilibrium is reached.
- The plasma membrane is flexible and is made up of organic molecules called lipids and proteins.
- The flexibility of the cell membrane also enables the cell to engulf in food and other material from its external environment. Such processes are known as endocytosis. Amoeba acquires its food through such processes.

### Cell Membrane
- Plant cells, in addition to the plasma membrane, have another rigid outer covering called the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside the plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plants.
- When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall. This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis
- Cell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to withstand very dilute (hypotonic) external media without bursting. In such media the cells tend to take up water by osmosis. The cell swells, building up pressure against the cell wall. The wall exerts an equal pressure against the swollen cell. Because of their walls, such cells can withstand much greater changes in the surrounding medium than animal cells.

### Nucleus
- The nucleus has a double layered covering called nuclear membrane. The nuclear membrane has pores which allow the transfer of material from inside the nucleus to its outside, that is, to the cytoplasm.
- The nucleus contains chromosomes, which are visible as rod-shaped structures only when the cell is about to divide. Chromosomes contain information for inheritance of characters from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are composed of DNA and protein.
- DNA molecules contain the information necessary for constructing and organising cells. Functional segments of DNA are called genes.
- In a cell which is not dividing, this DNA is present as part of chromatin material. Chromatin material is visible as entangled mass of thread like structures. Whenever the cell is about to divide, the chromatin material gets organised into chromosomes.

#### Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
- In some organisms like bacteria, the nuclear region of the cell may be poorly defined due to the absence of a nuclear membrane. Such an undefined nuclear region containing only nucleic acids is called a nucleoid. Such organisms, whose cells lack a nuclear membrane, are called prokaryotes (Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon = nucleus). Organisms with cells having a nuclear membrane are called eukaryotes.
- Prokaryotic cells also lack most of the other cytoplasmic organelles present in the eukaryotic cells

#### Cytoplasm
- The cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the plasma membrane. It also contains many specialised cell organelles. Each of these organelles performs a specific function for the cell.
- Cell organelles are enclosed by membranes. In prokaryotes, beside the absence of a defined nuclear region, the membrane-bound cell organelles are also absent. On the other hand, the eukaryotic cells have nuclear membrane as well as membrane-enclosed organelles.

#### Endoplasmic Reticulum
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large network of membrane-bound tubes and sheets. The ER membrane is similar in structure to the plasma membrane. There are two types of ER– rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a microscope because it has particles called ribosomes attached to its surface. The ribosomes, which are present in all active cells, are the sites of protein manufacture. The manufactured proteins are then sent to various places in the cell depending on need, using the ER. The SER helps in the manufacture of fat molecules, or lipids, important for cell function. Some of these proteins and lipids help in building the cell membrane. This process is known as membrane biogenesis.

#### Golgi Apparatus
The Golgi apparatus consists of a system of membrane-bound vesicles (flattened sacs) arranged approximately parallel to each other in stacks called cisterns. The material synthesised near the ER is packaged and dispatched to various targets inside and outside the cell through the Golgi apparatus. Its functions include the storage, modification and packaging of products in vesicles

#### Lysosomes
Lysosomes are membrane-bound sacs filled with digestive enzymes. These enzymes are made by RER. Lysosomes are a kind of waste disposal system of the cell. These help to keep the cell clean by digesting any foreign material as well as worn-out cell organelles. Foreign materials entering the cell, such as bacteria or food, as well as old organelles end up in the lysosomes, which break complex substances into simpler substances. Lysosomes are able to do this because they contain powerful digestive enzymes capable of breaking down all organic material.

#### Mitochondria
Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria have two membrane coverings. The outer membrane is porous while the inner membrane is deeply folded. These folds increase surface area for ATP generating chemical reactions. Mitochondria are strange organelles in the sense that they have their own DNA and ribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able to make some of their own proteins.






## UNIT 3
## Antigen - Antibodies

### Introduction
The immune system represents one of the most sophisticated biological defense mechanisms, comprising a coordinated network of organs, cells, and proteins that protect the body from pathogens while maintaining tolerance to self-tissues.

### Organs of Immune System
#### Primary Lymphoid Organs
- Bone Marrow
	- Present in the cavities of the bones specially vertebrates , leg bone 
	- Generates T Cells , B Cells , and marcophages - cells that travels through whole body through blood and tissue fluids
- Thymus
	- bilobed organ located above the heart near throat
	- train special white blood cells called T-cells

#### Secondary Lymphoid Organs
- Spleen
	- Bean shaped located left of the abdomen cavity
	- Specializes in filtering blood and traping antigen
- Lymph nodes
	- Solid bean shaped
	- armpits , mesenteries
	- network packed lymphocytes , marcophages , and dendritic cells

### Bone Anatomy
- Compact Bone
- Yellow Marrow
- Spongy bone
- Blood Vessels in Bone Marrow
- Spongy Bone contains red marrow

### Cells of Immune System
- Originates in bone marrow from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
- **Precursor cells** are **partially differentiated cells** that arise from **stem cells** and are committed to developing into a specific type of cell. They act as intermediates between **stem cells** and fully mature cells.
- HSCs give rise to precursor cells
	- Myeloids progenitors
		- Primarily part of the **innate immune system**
			- Granulocytes
			- Macrophages
			- Dendritic cells
			- Mast cells
	- Lymphoid progenitors
		- Primarily part of the **adaptive immune system**
			- Lymphocytes
			- Dendritic cells
			- Natural Killer cells


### Granulocytes 
- A group of white blood cells
- Three cell types
	- Neutrophils
		- Majority
		- First cell to arrive to the infection site
		- Neutrophils are highly **phagocytic**, meaning they engulf and digest pathogens.
		- Neutrophils kill pathogens through multiple mechanisms (Bactericidal)
	- Eosinophils
		- 1 - 3% 
		- Anti parasite defenses
		- Allergic Diseases
	- Basophils
		- Very less
		- non phagocytic cells
		- Major role in Allergic Response
		- Release their granules following exposure to specific allergens
- These cells are important in the removal of bacteria and parasites from the body.
- They engulf these foreign bodies and degrade them using their powerful enzymes.
### Lymphocytes
- T lymphocytes (Thymus and Bone marrow)
	- T cells control your body's immune response and directly attack and kill infected cells and tumor cells
- B lymphocytes (Bone marrow)
	- B cells make antibodies. Antibodies are protiens that target viruses , bacteria and foreign invaders

### MAST Cells

- released from bone marrow as undifferentiated precursor cells and remain same until they enter the tissue
- important role in the development of allergic response
- produce variety of cytokines (Cytokines are signaling proteins that help the immune system control inflammation and defend the body against sickness.)
- Tumor necrosis factor plays a key role in the body's inflammatory response and immune system. This is stored within cytoplasm of the mast cells , and it can be released quickly following mast cell activations

### Natural Killer Cells
- Natural Killer (NK) cells are a crucial component of the **innate immune system**, constituting **5–10% of lymphocytes in human peripheral blood**. 
- They specialize in **cell cytotoxicity**, targeting virus-infected and cancerous cells **without requiring prior sensitization**.

### Monocytes and Macrophages
#### Monocytes
- **Largest white blood cells (WBCs) in circulation**
- **Make up 2–10% of leukocytes in peripheral blood**
- Produced in the **bone marrow** and circulate in the **blood** before migrating into tissues
- Act as **precursors to macrophages and dendritic cells**

#### Macrophages
- **Mature monocytes that have migrated into tissues**
- Found in almost every organ (e.g., alveolar macrophages in the lungs, Kupffer cells in the liver)
- Longer-lived than monocytes


#### Macrophage Phagocytosis Mechanism
![[Pasted image 20250301005116.png]]
- A phagosome is a vesicle that forms when a phagocyte engulfs a particle, such as a microorganism or foreign particle

#### Dendritic Cells
- Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized **antigen-presenting cells (APCs)** that play a **critical role in linking the innate and adaptive immune systems**. They capture, process, and present antigens to **T cells**, initiating immune responses.
•Four types of dendritic cells are
	•Langerhan’s cells
	•Interstitial dendritic cells
	•Myeloid cells
	•Lymphoid dendritic cells

![[Pasted image 20250301005758.png]]


## Immunity
![[Pasted image 20250301022145.png]]

### Innate 
- This provides the first line of defence against infection.
- It is resistance to infections that an individual possesses by virtue of her or his genetic and constitutional make-up.
- It is not affected by prior contact with microorganisms or immunisation.
- It may be non -specific when it indicates a degree of resistance to infections in general, or specific, where resistance to a particular pathogen is concerned.
- Innate immunity may be considered at the level of the species, race or individual.
- Three types
	- Species
	- Race
	- Individual
- Factors
	- Age (Chickenpox in adults)
	- Hormonal (Diabetes in adults)
	- Nutrition (Malnutrition reduces immunity)

#### Mechanism of Immunity
![[Pasted image 20250301023755.png]]
#### Inflammatory response
![[Pasted image 20250301023923.png]]

### Adaptive Immunity
•Immunity which a person acquired during his  lifetime.
•This  is inducible and develops slowly than the innate response.
•This is specific kind of immunity and has memory, therefore providing long term protection.
•This occurs with contact of foreign particle.

#### Active
- Naturally acquired active immunity occurs when the person is exposed to a live pathogen, develops the disease, and becomes immune as a result of the primary immune response.
- Artificially acquired active immunity can be induced by a vaccine, a substance that contains the antigen. A vaccine stimulates a primary response against the antigen without causing symptoms of the disease.
#### Passive
- Artificially acquired passive immunity is a short-term immunization by the injection of antibodies, such as gamma globulin, that are not produced by the recipient's cells.
- Naturally acquired passive immunity occurs during pregnancy, in which certain antibodies are passed from the maternal into the fetal bloodstream

![[Pasted image 20250301024437.png]]![[Pasted image 20250301024536.png]]

### Antigens
- Antigen: A substance that enters the body and starts a process that can cause disease.
- Immunogen is a molecule that can trigger an immune response.
	- All immunogens are antigens, but not all antigens are immunogens.
- Hapten is a small molecule that can't trigger an immune response but only when attached to a large carrier such as a protein.
- Epitope also known as antigenic determinant, is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system.
![[Pasted image 20250301024929.png]]


### Antibody
- Specialized glycoprotein, produced from activated B cells (plasma cells) in response to an antigen.
- Antibody is a large protein composed of globulin chains
- Antibodies are also called immunoglobulins(Ig)
- Immunoglobulin (Ig) constitutes 20-25 per cent of total serum proteins.

#### Working
- They recognize antigens
- They show specificity towards a particular antigen
- Antibodies capture the invader by binding their antigens
- Paratope: It is part of the antibody that interacts with epitope(of antigen)

![[Pasted image 20250301031030.png]]![[Pasted image 20250301031311.png]]
- An antibody molecule is a ‘Y-shaped’, composed of four polypeptide chains.
- Two identical light (L) chains
- Two identical heavy (H) chains
- All four H and L chains are bound to each other by disulfide bonds, and by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic bonds.
- Each immunoglobulin peptide chain has intra chain disulphide bonds- form loops.
- Each loop is compactly folded to form a globular structure-domain.
- All the chains have two ends- an amino terminal end (NH3) and a carboxyl terminal end (COOH).
- Light chain contains a single variable domain (VL) and a single constant domain (CL).
- Heavy chain contains one variable domain (VH) and 3 constant domains (CH1, CH2, CH3)
- Hinge region is the segment in heavy chain - between CH1, CH2
- Within the variable region, there are some zones (hot spots) that show relatively higher variability in the amino acid sequences called as hyper variable regions or complementarity determining regions (CDRs).
- Antibodies can occur in two physical forms
	1. Soluble form that is secreted from the cell,
	2. Membrane-bound form
		- That is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR).
		- The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells
		- Facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells
		- That will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.

#### Types of Antibodies or Immunoglobulin
- IgG 
	- 70 %
	- Maximum daily production
	- 23 days lifespan
	- Functions :
		- IgG can cross placenta - hence provide immunity to the fetus and new born.Among subclasses, IgG2 has the poorest ability to cross placenta.
		- IgG plays a major role in neutralization of toxins as it can easily diffuse into extravascular space.
- IgM
	- Highest molecular weight
	- only in intravascular compartment
	- monomer(membrane bound) or pentamer(secreted form)
	- Functions :
		- Earliest immunoglobulin to be synthesized by fetus (20 weeks).
		- Acute infection
		- Protection against intravascular organisms
- IgA
	-  monomer(serum) or dimer
	- Body Secretions
	- Functions:
		- Effective against bacteria like Salmonella and viruses like polio and influenza.
		- Breast milk is rich in secretory IgA and provides good protection to the immunologically immature infant gut.
- IgE
	- lowest concetration
	- Extravascular 
- IgD
	- IgD together with IgM is major membrane bound immunoglobulin on unstimulated B lymphocytes-acts as recognition receptors for antigens



### Ag-Ab Interactions
There are three stages to the interactions between Ag and Ab.
- The first stage of the reaction entails the formation of the Ag-Ab complex.
- The second stage results in visible phenomena like agglutination, precipitation, etc.
- The third stage involves the destruction or neutralization of Ag.

#### Strength of Ag-Ab interaction
- Affinity :The strength of the interaction between a single antibody and a single epitope on an antigen.
- Avidity: This term is used to describe the overall strength of the collective binding interactions that occur during multivalent binding

#### Types of Reaction
- Agglutination 
	- Antigen antibody agglutination is a reaction that occurs when antibodies, bind to antigens and cause them to clump together.
	- Example: blood typing
- Precipitation
	- When Ag combines with its Ab it forms an insoluble precipitate of Ag-Ab complex. The reaction is called as precipitation reaction.

#### Cross Reactivity
- Although Antibodies are antigen specific sometimes they exhibit cross reactivity
- Cross-reactivity between antigens occurs when an antibody raised against one specific antigen has a competing high affinity toward a different antigen.



## UNIT 2

### Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
DNA ----> RNA --->Protein
#### Transcription
- From DNA to mRNA
- Three Stages
	- Initiation
		- RNA Polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called the promoter
		- Each gene once bound , RNAP separates the DNA strands 
			- **RNA Polymerase Works in One Direction (5' → 3')**
				- **RNA polymerase** can only synthesize RNA in the **5' → 3'** direction.
				- To do this, it must read the DNA template in the **3' → 5'** direction.
				- Since the **antisense strand** runs **3' → 5'**, it is the only strand RNA polymerase can use as a template.
		- Elongation 
	- Termination
#### Translation
- From mRNA to Proteins

### Gene Structure
- A **gene** is a **specific sequence of DNA** that contains the instructions for making a **functional product**, typically a **protein** or a functional **RNA molecule**.
- Transcription Factor
	- Protein that controls rate of transcription by binding to promotor and recruiting RNAP

#### **Introns and Exons: Structure and Function**

Genes in **eukaryotic cells** consist of two main types of sequences:

- **Exons** → Coding regions that are expressed in the final mRNA.
- **Introns** → Non-coding regions that are removed before translation.

These sequences are **part of a gene’s pre-mRNA** and play a key role in gene expression and regulation.

---

### **1. Exons: The Coding Sequences**

✅ **Definition**: Exons are the regions of a gene that **contain instructions for making proteins**.  
✅ **Function**: After transcription, exons are **spliced together** to form mature **mRNA**, which is translated into proteins.  
✅ **Example**: In the gene for insulin, the exons contain the codons that specify the amino acid sequence of the insulin protein.

---

### **2. Introns: The Non-Coding Sequences**

❌ **Definition**: Introns are **non-coding** sequences found within a gene.  
❌ **Function**: They are **transcribed but not translated**; they are **removed** during **RNA splicing** before translation.  
❌ **Role**:

- **Gene regulation**: Some introns contain regulatory elements that influence gene expression.
- **Alternative splicing**: Introns allow a single gene to code for multiple proteins by enabling different exon combinations.
- **Evolutionary significance**: Introns allow for genetic variation and new protein functions through exon shuffling.


#### Codon
- A **genetic codon** is a **three-nucleotide sequence** in mRNA that codes for a **specific amino acid** or a **stop signal** during protein synthesis. The set of all codons forms the **genetic code**, which is **universal** across almost all organisms.
- Redundancy of Genetic Coding 
	- One amino acid = Many possible codon coding



#### Promoters in Prokaryotes
- TTGACG -> -35bp
- TATAAT -> -10bp
- Transcription Start -> +1 where RNAP starts synthesizing mRNA
- Region from -35 to -10 is sigma factor or Transcription Factor - protein that controls the rate of transcription by binding the promoter to RNAP
- Regulate turn on and off so that right genes are expressed at right time and in the right amount

#### Promoter in Eukaryotes
- TATA -> -30 region - General Transcription Factor - Core Promoters that required for basic transcription of all gene
- Specific Transcription Factor -Enhancer or Repressors 
- Distal Promoter - helps to regulate gene and do not help in initiation of transcription



### Ribosome
- Three Sites 
	- P site -- Peptidyl - Holds the growing polypeptide chain AUG binds directly
	- A site -- Aminoacyl - Recieve a new incoming tRNA
	- E site
- Codon Recognition - New tRNA at A stie
- Peptide Bond Formation -  Peptide bond with amino acid at A and P
- Translocation - Ribosome Translocate thus moving forward in the mRNA
